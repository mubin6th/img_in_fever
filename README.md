<h1>img_in_fever <code>(iif)</code></h1>

`iif`, a tool to convert any image to a warm and eye-appealing image.
the program the
[gruvbox-material](https://github.com/sainnhe/gruvbox-material)
theme along with my hand crafted colors to quantize any image to
those specific warm colors.

## Building
Currently, I've only tested the building the project on Linux.


If you are on Linux, run `make` at the project directory.
After compiling, the `iif` executable will be generated in
the root directory of the project.


Run the generated executable to see `help` message.


There shouldn't be any issue compiling as the libraries are
statically linked or a just header file.
